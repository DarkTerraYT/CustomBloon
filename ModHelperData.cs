In the mod menu create a mod called CustomBloon and put the source code into the mod folder.\nYou can see where the mod sources are kept in the config for the Mod Helper.\nAfter that open the .sln file which should be called CustomBloon.sln and go to build and click on Build CustomBloon, Build Solution (which is used when you have multiple projects in the solution) or press Ctrl+B.\nMake sure you delete the original .dll first.
